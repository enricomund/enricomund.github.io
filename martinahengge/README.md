# Description  
This is the repository for my personal website, which features information about myself and my various projects, as well as a blog where I post about helpful development-related tools and tutorials.  
The site is hosted by [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.c**om/) from GitHub's servers and uses a customized theme based on the [Spectral](https://github.com/arkadianriver/spectral) theme by *arkadianriver*.  

***Note:*** Although the redesigned website is now live, I expect there will still be a few obligatory issues to fix over the next couple weeks, so please let me know if you run into any issues.
